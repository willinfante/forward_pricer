# forward_pricer

This is a very basic forward points calculator that I created from what I learned in the Lehman Brothers FX Training Manual. I did not include any quote fetching part in the code since it is meant for the user to use whichever quote they would like to calculate the points/forward rate. You can also calculate a forward rate from a bid-ask spread like: 1.4023/26. That part of the code still needs to be tested more to ensure it works with a variety of different pip sizes. I also need to do more testing to see if this works with a wider variety of currencies (I have only tested this based on the examples from the manual).
